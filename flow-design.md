## ** Proposed Flow (Summarized \& Clarified)**
We are changing the current hireflow (dont delete the code yet)

1. **Signup → Immediately Lead to “Setup Workspace” (Company Info)**
    - This sets the context and feels natural (just like Slack/Notion/Linear onboarding).
2. **After Company Setup, Navigate to Workspace Dashboard (Unique URL for Org-workspace)**
    - This is both the **hub** and the “home” for all team activity.
    - UI can show company info probabiliy like a profile or on the left top , list of AI employees cards, “Add New Employee” button.
    - (Optional but recommended: Unique URLs like `company/workspace/[workspace-or-projectname-slug-or-id]` feel familiar and enable easy sharing, future team invites, and state management.)
3. **Adding an AI Employee is a Sub-workflow (Modal or Route):**
    - Follows these steps:

4. Role Selection
5. Configuration
6. Integrations
7. Brand Guidelines
8. First Task
9. Welcome/Success
    - User can repeat this flow (“Add Another AI Employee”) from dashboard any time.

***

## **Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Dashboard (Workspace) Distinction:**
On first login, workspace can be semi-empty, with a prominent “Add Your First AI Employee” CTA and a celebration after creation.
    - Later, the dashboard shows AI employees, their status, recent activity/tasks, and navigation to settings/integrations.
- **Persistent Workspace Context:**
Use `/workspace/[id or slug]` or `/dashboard` as the central route after signup; if you’re building for org-use (as opposed to single-user trial), unique workspaces are strongly recommended.
- **Allow for Future Collaboration:**
Even if you don’t support team invites yet, structuring everything under a workspace future-proofs and keeps state logically scoped.
- **“Add Employee” UX:**
Prefer a modal or a side-panel if the dashboard is your persistent hub, or route to `/workspace/[id]/hire` for a focused full-screen multi-step flow—either works, just keep navigation clear.


***

**Goal:**
Implement the onboarding flow for an AI Employee SaaS as follows:

### **1. Signup → Company Setup**

- After successful signup (via `/app/signup`), after sign redirect user to `/app/workspace/setup` (implement as preferrelogically work- the reason is we could develop a diffrent workspace for same user account ).
- Here, render the “Company Info” step:
    - Form fields: Company Name, Industry (dropdown), Company Size (radio or select), Current AI employee size
- On successful submit:
    - Create a new Workspace in Supabase tied to the user.
    - Generate (and store) a unique URL (e.g., `/workspace/[id | slug]`), redirect user there.

***

### **2. Workspace Dashboard (“/workspace/[id]” or `/dashboard`)**

- This is the organization’s **home screen**.
    - If there are no employees: show empty state (“Welcome! Add your first AI Employee.”) with a bright CTA or action card.
    - If there are employees: show a card/list/grid of all current AI employees, each showing:
        - Role, status, name, quick actions (view, edit, pause).
        - Shortcut to “Assign Task” and “Performance” metrics.
    - Prominent button: “Add AI Employee”
    - Side navigation (if used): Company info, Integrations, Members (for future), Settings.

***

### **3. Add New AI Employee (Modal, Drawer, or Dedicated Route—Your Choice)**

#### **Multi-Step Flow (use Route, Modal, or Side Drawer as best fits your pattern):**

1. **Step 1: Role Selection**
    - Large, clickable role cards (Marketing, Sales, HR, etc.) with brief descriptions. Resuse what is there as acard in the current hire-flow component 
    - Selection proceeds to next step.
2. **Step 2: Configuration**
    - Name (auto/optional), Responsibilities (toggle list), Autonomy Slider/Radio, Timezone.
    - Optionally: Advanced config (later).
3. **Step 3: Integrations**
    - Detect available tools, offer Connect buttons per integration (OAuth or fake/mock as needed).
    - Show connected status, retry on failure.
4. **Step 4: Brand Guidelines**
    - Voice/tone picker, topics to focus/avoid, sample content rules.
    - Simple defaults—can skip, add later.
5. **Step 5: First Task**
    - Suggest templates, let user assign a custom task, pick priority/deadline.
6. **Step 6: Success/Welcome**
    - Show AI employee in action, next steps (review drafts, assign more), link back to main dashboard.

***

### **4. Repeatable Employee Addition**

- User can re-enter “Add AI Employee” flow from dashboard as often as needed.
- All created employees listed, with their history and status.

***

### **5. Technical/Implementation Notes**

- Preserve existing file structure and **theme (see image)**.
- Use Supabase for all workspace/user/employee data.
- Use `/hire` folder if you prefer to neatly split out only employee-creation logic as another route under app.
- Use one-level deep `/workspace/[id]` or `/dashboard` for the home hub.
- **Use shadcn/ui and your current Tailwind setup for all forms, cards, navigation, and buttons.**
- all API/database calls should use a service layer, store everything in Supabase according to the earlier schema.

***

### **Component Mapping (Corresponding to your file structure):**

- **Sign Up:** `/app/signup/signup-form.tsx`
- **Company Setup (Workspace Creation):** `/app/hire/CompanySetup.tsx` or `/app/hire-flow.tsx`
- **Workspace Dashboard:** `/app/dashboard-preview.tsx`
- **Add Employee Flow:** `/components/hire-flow.tsx` (stepper/modal) or `/app/hire-flow.tsx` (full route)
    - Steps: RoleSelection.tsx, AIConfiguration.tsx, Integrations.tsx, BrandGuidelines.tsx, FirstTask.tsx, Welcome.tsx
- **Reuse:** Navigation, ProgressBar, Button from `/components/ui`

***

**Implement this exact onboarding flow:**

- After signup: show company info, create workspace.
- Take user to their workspace dashboard.
- Let them add/manage multiple AI employees using an intuitive, step-by-step flow.
- Leverage your current codebase structure.

**Design the UI to be simple, business-like, and friendly.**
**Persist all progress in Supabase, show helpful progress and success states.**
